-- How to code summary queries

-- Objectives

-- Applied

-- Code summary queries that use
-- aggregate functions, including queries
-- that use the WITH ROLLUP operator
-- and the GROUPING and IF functions.

-- Code summary queries that use
-- aggregate window functions, including
-- functions that use frames and named windows.

-- Knowledge

-- Describe summary queries.

-- Describe the differences between the
-- HAVING clause and the WHERE clause.

-- Describe the use of the WITH ROLLUP operator.
-- Describe the use of the GROUPING and
-- IF functions with the WITH ROLLUP operator.

-- Describe the use of the aggregate
-- window functions.

-- The syntax of the aggregate functions

-- AVG([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)
-- SUM([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)
-- MIN([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)
-- MAX([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)
-- COUNT([ALL|DISTINCT] expression)
-- COUNT(*)

-- A summary query
